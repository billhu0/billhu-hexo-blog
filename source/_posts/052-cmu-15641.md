# Lecture 1

- **Propagation Delay**: how long the first bit is received
- **Transmission Delay**: how long it takes to put the remaining data

- Packet Latency = Transmission Delay + Propagation Delay



# Lecture 3

解决多个设备同时发送/接收会冲突的问题

Solution: **Random Access Protocols**

- Carrier Sense: listen before you send
- Collision Detection: detect collisions and back off
  - Listen **while** you transmit. 
  - If you detect another signal, stop transmitting. Ethernet has you also send a special 'JAM' signal to tell other listeners that the transmission has been corrupted and stopped.
  - **Collision Recovery**: **Random Exponential Backoff**
    - 随机等待一段时间，随着冲突次数增加，随机等待时间的抽样范围变长
    - first collision: choose K from {0, 1}, delay K x 512 bit transmission times (timeslot)
    - second collision: choose K from {0,1,2,3}
    - 10+ collisions: choose K from {0,1, ..., 1023}
  - **Ethernet Multiple Access Protocol (CSMA/CD)**??  not used today 
- Collision Avoidance: request permission to send



**MAC addresses** (Media access control address)

- 48-bit long. Do not have a structure (think of them as random)

**Ethernet Packet**

- ![An Ethernet Packet](052-cmu-15641/ethernet-packet.png)
- **Preamble**: e.g. always 1010101010... repeating
- **SFD**: Start Frame Delimiter
- **FCS**: Frame Check Sequence (to detect errors)

**Routing**

- Routing, Generation 1: **Broadcast**
  - Everybody receives the package.
  - **Learning Switch Algorithm**
