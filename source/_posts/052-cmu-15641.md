# Lec 1

- **Propagation Delay**: how long the first bit is received
- **Transmission Delay**: how long it takes to put the remaining data

- Packet Latency = Transmission Delay + Propagation Delay



# Lec 3

解决多个设备同时发送/接收会冲突的问题

Solution: **Random Access Protocols**

- Carrier Sense: listen before you send
- Collision Detection: detect collisions and back off
  - Listen **while** you transmit. 
  - If you detect another signal, stop transmitting. Ethernet has you also send a special 'JAM' signal to tell other listeners that the transmission has been corrupted and stopped.
  - **Collision Recovery**: **Random Exponential Backoff**
    - 随机等待一段时间，随着冲突次数增加，随机等待时间的抽样范围变长
    - first collision: choose K from {0, 1}, delay K x 512 bit transmission times (timeslot)
    - second collision: choose K from {0,1,2,3}
    - 10+ collisions: choose K from {0,1, ..., 1023}
  - **Ethernet Multiple Access Protocol (CSMA/CD)**??  not used today 
- Collision Avoidance: request permission to send



**MAC addresses** (Media access control address)

- 48-bit long. Do not have a structure (think of them as random)

**Ethernet Packet**

- ![An Ethernet Packet](052-cmu-15641/ethernet-packet.png)
- **Preamble**: e.g. always 1010101010... repeating
- **SFD**: Start Frame Delimiter
- **FCS**: Frame Check Sequence (to detect errors)

**Routing**

- Routing, Generation 1: **Broadcast**
  - Everybody receives the package.
  - **Learning Switch Algorithm**

## Spanning Tree Protocol

**Distributed Spanning Tree Overview**

- Embed a **tree** that provides a single unique path to each destination.
- Bridge with lowest ID (MAC addr) is **root**. 指定ID最小的人是root
- Each bridge finds and remembers the **shortest path to root**. 每人记住到root的最短长度和路径
- All nodes keep a simple data structure: **(Root, Path Length, Next Hop)** 

Basic Algorithm (交流建立tree的方法)

- Assume you are the root. Store (Me, 0, Me).
- Do {
  - tell neighbors (root, pathLength, yourID)
  - listen to neighbors, keep getting updates ... while ...
    - if their root ID is smaller, replace root, pathLength++
    - if their root ID is same but pathLength is shorter, replace pathLength and ++
    - if neighbor A and neighbor B both tell the same root, choose the shorter pathLength



**Resilience**: （指系统在遇到错误和挑战时还能不能保持正常功能）

**Fully distributed**: does not assume previous existence of a central coordinator

**Distance Vector (DV)**

- Each router maintains its **shortest distance to every destination** via **each of its neighbors**.
- Distance can be other value, e.g. latency.
