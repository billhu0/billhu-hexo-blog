## Information security

**Information security**: The **protection** of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**.

- **Confidentiality**: the property that sensitive information is **not disclosed** to **unauthorized** individuals, entities or processes.

- **Integrity**: the property that sensitive data has **not been modified or deleted** in an **unauthorized and undetected** manner. 
- **Authentication**: the process of estabilishing confidence in the identity of users or information systems.
- **Non-Repudiation**: assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the sender's identity, so neither can later deny having processed the information.

## Private-key Encryption (PrivKE)

![PrivKE](40-cs252/privke.png)

> - $\mathrm{Gen}$ = key generation, $\mathrm{Enc}$ = encryption, $\mathrm{Dec}$ = decryption
> - $k$ = secret key, $m$ = plaintext (message), $c$ = ciphertext
> - $\mathcal{K}$ = key space, $\mathcal{M}$ = plaintext space, $\mathcal{C}$ = ciphertext space

- $\mathrm{PrivKE} = (\mathrm{Gen, Enc, Dec}) + \mathcal{M}$
  - **Correctness**: $\mathrm{Dec(k, \mathrm{Enc}(k, m)) = m}$
  - **Security**: the adversary should not be able to learn $m$ from $c$



## Kerchkhoff's Principle

**Principle**: The **cipher method must not be required to be secret**, and it must be able to fall into the hands of the enemy without inconvenience. 加密算法应该公开.



## Shift Cipher

Scheme: $c_i = m_i + k$

![](40-cs252/shift-cipher.png)

**Brute-force attack**: try all possible secret keys 

**Sufficient Key Space Principle**: key space $|\mathcal{K}|$ should be large enough



## Substitution Cipher

Scheme: $c_i = \sigma(m_i)$

![](40-cs252/substitution-cipher.png)

- Key space is large for brute-force attack.

- Still not secure! Can be broken letter frequency analysis. 可通过字母频率破解.



## Vigenere Cipher

Scheme: $c_i$ = the letter obtained by shifting $m_i$ forward $k_{(i\  \mathrm{mod}\  t) + 1}$ positions

![](40-cs252/vigenere-cipher.png)

- Key space is infinite in theory. In addition, same letter in plaintext can be mapped into different letters in ciphertext

- Still not secure! 

  - **Kasiski's method**: two identical segments of plaintext may be encrypted to same ciphertext if their distance is a multiple of key length $t$. 

    Search for pairs of identical segments → record distances → calculate GCD

    Find the key length $t$ and then break $t$ shift ciphers.

## Classical & Modern Cryptograohy

- **Classical cryptography**: art, not science
  - no formal definition of security
  - no proof of security
  - all historical ciphers have been badly broken (ciphertext $c$ → adversary can recover both message $m$ and secret key $k$ )

- **Modern cryptography**: a science
  - Principles: 三个原则
    1. **Formal definitions of security**
    1. **Precise assumptions**
    1. **Proofs of security**



## Formal definitions of security

**Threat model**: defines the power of the adversary

Typical threat models for private-key encryption (COA, KPA, CPA, CCA)

- **Ciphertext-only Attack (COA)** 密文攻击
  - Adversary observes ciphertext
  - It tries to determine plaintext
- **Known-Plaintext Attack (KPA)** 已知明文攻击
  - Adversary learns pairs of plaintext and ciphertext generated using some key
  - It tries to determine information about plaintext of some other ciphertext produced using the same key.
- **Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA)** 选择明文攻击
  - Adversary obtains plaintext/ciphertext pairs for plaintexts of its choice (攻击者选择一段明文欺骗A或B帮他加密)
  - It tries to determine plaintext of some other ciphertext produced using the same key.
- **Chosen-ciphertext Attack (CCA)** 选择秘闻攻击
  - Adversary obtains plaintext/ciphertext pairs for plaintexts/ciphertexts of its choice. (不仅能CPA还能选择一段密文欺骗A或B帮他解密)
  - It tries to determine plaintext of some other ciphertext produced using the same key



**A security definition looks like**: a cryptographic scheme for a given task is secure if no adversary of **a specific power** (指定攻击者的power) can achieve a **specified break** (指定攻击类型).



## Precise Assumptions

**Assumption** (假设): Statements that are not proven but conjectured to be true 未经证明但猜测为真的命题

E.g The integer factoring problem / discrete logarithm problem is hard.

(The integer factoring problem 大整数分解问题)



## Proofs of security

**Provable security**: If the designed cryptographic scheme can be broken by an adversary, then the underlying assumption is false. (类似于反证法: 假设方案不安全，adv能攻破，推出assumption不成立)

If the scheme is not secure, then a well-known hard problem can be solved in polynomial time.



# Lec 4.

## Probability



### Distributions on $\mathcal{K,M,C}$

- **Secret Key** $K$: output of $\mathrm{Gen}$, an r.v. taking values in $\mathcal{K}$
  - $\mathrm{Pr}[K=k]$, determined by **key generation** algorithm
  - e.g. $K$ is uniform (均匀分布) in shift cipher / substitution cipher
- **Plaintext** $M$: 
  - $\mathrm{Pr}[M=m]$, determined by sender's preference (明文的先验概率)
- **Ciphertext** $C$: output of $\mathrm{Enc}(K,M)$
  - $\mathrm{Pr}[C=c]$



**Fundamental assumption**: K,M are independent random variables.

基本假设: K M 独立



## Perfect Secrecy 完善保密性

- **Definition**: $\Pi = (\mathrm{Gen, Enc, Dec}) + \mathcal{M}$ is perfectly secret if

  - $\forall$ distribution $M$, $\forall m\in M$, $\forall c\in C$ with $\mathrm{Pr[C=c]} > 0$, 

    $\mathrm{Pr}[M=m|C=c] = \mathrm{Pr}[M=m]$

- Perfect secrecy requires $M,C$ to be independent

  明文的概率分布和密文概率分布无关

- For simplicity, assume $\mathrm{Pr[C=c]} > 0$

- Security guarantee: The adversary learns no additional information about $m$ given $c$. 

  敌手获得密文c之前和之后，对明文m的认识没有改变（对明文m的后验概率分布和先验概率分布一致）



- **Theorem**: $\Pi$ is perfectly secret if and only if 

  - $\forall m, m' \in \mathcal{M}, \forall c \in \mathcal{C}$

    $\mathrm{Pr}[\mathrm{Enc}(K,m) = c] = \mathrm{Pr}[\mathrm{Enc}(K,m') = c]$



## One-Time Pad

**Scheme**:

- $\mathrm{Gen}$: $k = {\{0,1\}}^n$
- $\mathrm{Enc}$: $c = k \oplus m$ (密文是明文和key逐位取异或)
- $\mathrm{Dec}$: $m = k \oplus c$

**Theorem**: one-time pad **is perfectly secret**.

- $\mathrm{Pr}[C=c|M=m] = \mathrm{Pr}[C=c|M=m'] = 2^{-n}$

**Drawbacks**:

- 1. **long secret key** (as long as message) 密钥长度与明文长度相同, 太长了

     **Kerckhoffs**: **It must be possible to communicate and remember the key without using written notes**, and correspondents must be able to change or modify it as will.

  2. **one-time** security: same key cannot be used more than once
